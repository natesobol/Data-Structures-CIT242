HERE IS A LIST OF THE POSSIBLE HW ASSIGNMENTS. IF YOU DO MORE THAN 3 THEN I
WILL AWARD YOU EXTRA CREDIT !!!

Subject: BHCC Homework

==========================================================
PLEASE NOTE THAT I PUT THE REQUIREMEMNTS FOR THE FINAL PROJECT AT THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM
OF THIS DOCUMENT JUST IN CLASE.  FOR ALL OTHER CLASS ASSIGNMENTS PLEASE SCROLL DOWN!!!!

Final Project

This is based on what we did in class. Look at the programs at the following link:
H:\CIT242Spring2017\XML-Field_Added-UpdateAdded
For the final you are to make up a program using the above as a template.
Your program is of your own design and must have at least 3 fields that are all different type.
Please do not just edit my program as that is extemelt obvious.
Good luck,
Jack


***HW1
========

Add the Listdelete Method to the StackApp.java and the QueueApp.java



***HW2
====================
Look at the code from the LinkedListDemo.java file and add a method to the
StackApp.java and QueueApp.java programs that
will insert a node at a specific location

example
listinsert(3,part);
This is a modification of the listinsert function that I showed you but this
one will add a node at any position of the stack or queue.
If you write this correctly it should work for either without modification.




*** Extra Credit 1
=================
Again looking at the code for the LinkedListDemo.java write 2 methods one that
will
listinsertfirst(part);
listinsertlast(part);

remember that "part" is the object of the class Entry !!!!!

***HW 3
========
Using what you have learned in packages take the
StackApp.java program
And place Class Entry in a package as well as Class NODE
Show that the code runs with your two packages!!!!

===============================================================================
====
***HW 4
Take the TableDisplay-3-Fields and add another field from the Access Database
============================================================
***HW 5
Make a structure like we did in class for the DFS and BFS. Now display the
output using the DFS and BFS programs.
